msgid "All Python code in this package should be PEP8 valid. However, we don't enforce the 80-char line length rule. It is encouraged to have your code formatted in 80-char lines, but somewhere it's just more readable to break this rule for a few characters. Long and descriptive test method names are a good example of this."

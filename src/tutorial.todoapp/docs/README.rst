    It’s a fact - Plone has a lot of complicated features. That doesn’t mean
    Plone is hard for everything! This is a simple tutorial that anyone can
    follow to get a simple Todo list application running inside of Plone.

    not. You can however learn several simple, fast concepts that will get you
    most of the way there. Feeling like you don’t understand something
    completely or the terminology is getting to you? Sit back, relax, and finish
    the tutorial. If in the end things still aren’t clear, please give feedback
